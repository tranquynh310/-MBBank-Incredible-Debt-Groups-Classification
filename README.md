Identify incredible customers based on their financial transactions and debt classification group.

As part of the requirements, you as a data analyst have to decide “Which group of debts are incredible”, as long as it helps to distinguish between credible and incredible customers.

-  Customers with high transaction values seem to have a higher tendency to be in the credible groups.
-  Number of months seems to be a good predictor for debt group classification
